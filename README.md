# simple-full-stack

This is a very basic full stack application using angular.  In addition to this code, on my backend I created a database that I called 'experiment' with a table called 'dummy' containing a value: 'It Works'.  You can use your own unique database to test with; just reconfigure by changing the database name in the config.js file, the table name in the database_call.sql file, and the table column name in the ctrl.js file.
